					<h2>Color Schemes</h2>
					<h4>Oct 5th 2016</h4>
					<p>First glance at the color theory is overwhelming. So much to learn for a beginner. The color red gives the user an uneasy feeling, green is the color of knowledge, yellow is best used for warnings. Seems like I can't just pick different tones of my favourite color. Diving in a little deeper I realize I'm also picking colors that clash, this styling process seems pretty challenging. However I did pick up a great tip for beginners. Use shades if you haven't mastered the proper use of colors. The color theory is definitely something I want to come back to, but for now I just want learn to code. Hello black white and various other shades of gray in between.</p>

					<h2>W3School HTML Section</h2>
					<h4>Oct 4th 2016</h4>
					<p>Learning and applying my first set of tools. H1 - H6 for headings. Making borders, outlines and adding color. At last the first connection is made. Making a navigation menu. So far the tools are starting to make sense.</p>

					<h2>First Struggles</h2>
					<h4>Oct 3rd 2016</h4>
					<p>The first road block was figuring out what topic to make my very first website about. The next step will be figuring out what tools to use and how to use them. I grew up in a Cambodian house hold in Canada, so I speak Khmer and English. My oldest brother is deaf so I also know some ASL (I use a lot more finger spelling than I'd like to admit). Maybe I can make some sort of website show casing my knowledge with these languages.</p>
